Your boss has given you the following project to fix for a client. It's supposed
to be a simple dice game, where the object of the game is to correctly add up
the values of the dice for 6 consecutive turns.

The issue is that a former programmer worked on it who didn't know how to debug
effectively. It's now up to you to clean up this code and add tests.

To run the program, type the following in your terminal:

```shell
python main.py
``` 

What bugs/issues did you fix in the code? List as bullet points below.

Some bugs I fixed included how the die counts the values in line 19 on runner.py, where
instead I called die.value to add the total die value instead of the amount of die as it did
before.

I fixed the throws an error call when playing the game, and instead had it exit the program file.

In my third step, I correctly the lose and win counter within the game

* 

What tests did you add? List at least three behaviors you are checking for.
  Example: All dice have values between 1 and 6 (inclusive).

I hope that all my rounds are counted correctly.
I hope that my game works end-to-end.
I hope to correctly counts loses and wins and users.
